I am a PhD student at the [Conversational AI Lab](https://uiuc-conversational-ai-lab.github.io/) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), advised by [Dr. Dilek Hakkani-Tur](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/dilek) and [Dr. Gokhan Tur](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/gokhan).

My research interests lie in the intersection of natural language processing and machine learning, with a focus on dialogue systems. I am currently working on evaluating the persuasive capabilities of conversational agents. I am also interested in long-context dialogue understanding and generation.

Prior to joining UIUC, I received my B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Arizona in 2024. During my undergraduate studies, I worked with [Dr. Steve Bethard](https://bethard.github.io/) from the [CLU Lab](https://clulab.org/) on the tasks of multilingual intimacy analysis and spoiler detection and generation.
